I recently started working at Google. I expect to be writing in this space about Dart, HTML5,
Web Components and whatever else I encounter that might be interesting to anyone else.

This blog is created using Octopress, a framework designed for Jekyll, the static blogging engine
that powers Github Pages. Using Octopress, I can use Markdown, embed code from my filesystem, download and embed gists, 
embed code from jsFiddle, and publish easily via a git push.
